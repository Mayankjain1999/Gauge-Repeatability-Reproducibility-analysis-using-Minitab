# Measurement System Analysis-using-Minitab

# Project Title
Measurement System Analysis (MSA) â€“ Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility (GRR) Study on Shaft Diameter Measurement
# Background
In a precision machining unit producing steel shafts, the diameter of each shaft is a critical quality parameter. To ensure product consistency, it is essential that the measurement system (dial micrometer) used to inspect the shafts is accurate and consistent across multiple operators and parts.
This study aims to evaluate the measurement variation contributed by the instrument (repeatability) and operators (reproducibility).
# Objective

To assess the reliability of the measurement system by conducting a Gauge R&R study using Minitab.

Determine the percentage of total variation due to measurement system (equipment + operator).

Identify if the current measurement system is acceptable for process control.

Provide recommendations for improvement if variation is excessive.
